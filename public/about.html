Led by Kevin Abstract and formed partially through the online forum "KanyeToThe", Brockhampton is a self-described boy band, in an effort to redefine the term.Complex magazine describes the group as "gay, black, white, DIY, ambitious, all-inclusive, and would-be pop stars," and this diversity is what largely distinguishes their lyrics and sound.The group consists of vocalists Kevin Abstract, Matt Champion, Merlyn Wood, and Dom McLennon, vocalists/producers Joba and Bearface.

Their fourth album, Iridescence, was released on September 21, 2018 and debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 album chart. The album is also the first in their second trilogy, known as "The Best Years of Our Lives".
